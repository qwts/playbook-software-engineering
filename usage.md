## Shared Agent Behaviors

Every agent in this guide behaves the same way on these two points; the per-agent **Key Behaviors** sections list only what differs.

- **Interactive** — The agent waits for your answers before moving on. You can skip sections or go deeper as needed.
- **Confirmation before fetch/diagram** — If you ask for documentation or diagrams, the agent will ask: *"Would you like me to [fetch X / create a diagram]? Or do you have your own to reference?"* It only proceeds after you confirm.
