## 1. Project Overview
- [ ] Describe the overall purpose of the project
- [ ] Define success criteria and expected outcomes
- [ ] Identify key stakeholders and sponsors
- What are the primary objectives and how do they align with business goals?
- Who will be involved and what are their roles?

## 2. Infrastructure Requirements
### 2.1 Cloud Platform and Region
- [ ] Confirm AWS, Azure, or GCP as the primary provider
- [ ] Select appropriate regions based on latency, compliance, or cost
- Which cloud provider will be used and why?
- Are there specific region-based compliance needs?

### 2.2 VPC/Virtual Network/Subnet Configuration
- [ ] Determine IP address ranges
- [ ] Decide on public vs. private subnets for security and access control
- How should traffic flow between subnets?
- Any requirements for on-premises connectivity (VPN, Direct Connect/ExpressRoute/Interconnect)?

## 3. Identity and Access Management
- [ ] Define roles and associated permissions
- [ ] Configure service accounts for application-level access
- Which users, groups, or services need access?
- What level of permissions is required (read, write, admin)?

## 4. Security Considerations
- [ ] Determine network security group/firewall configurations
- [ ] Define encryption needs for data at rest and in transit
- Are there specific compliance or audit requirements?
- Any additional security measures like intrusion detection or DDoS protection?

## 5. Scalability and Availability
- [ ] Identify expected workload and capacity planning
- [ ] Plan for autoscaling, load balancing, and redundancy
- What are peak usage times and resource usage patterns?
- Is high availability or disaster recovery required?

## 6. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Decide on logging and monitoring platforms or services
- [ ] Define alerting and incident response processes
- Which metrics are most critical to track?
- Who is responsible for handling alerts?

## 7. Governance and Compliance
- [ ] Establish policies for resource naming, tagging, cost management
- [ ] Review relevant compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI, etc.)
- Are there specific reporting or auditing requirements?
- How will cost and resource governance be tracked?

## 8. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Define test environments (dev, staging, production)
- [ ] Validate subnet and routing configurations
- What types of testing will be done (functional, performance, security)?
- Which QA processes or tools will be used?

## 9. Documentation and Handover
- [ ] Outline required architectural diagrams, support docs, and runbooks
- [ ] Plan for knowledge transfer to operations teams
- Which teams or individuals will maintain the documentation?
- How often should the documentation be updated?

## 10. Timeline and Next Steps
- [ ] Establish milestones for each phase of provisioning
- [ ] Assign responsibilities and track progress
- What is the overall project schedule and who is accountable for deliverables?
- Are there any major dependencies or risks that might impact the timeline?
