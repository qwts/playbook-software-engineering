# SOP: Release and versioning

How a `qwts` repo that cuts releases tracks versions, records changes, and
handles dependency bumps. Shared baseline under [ENG-0008](../decisions/ENG-0008-shared-sop-inheritance.md).
This SOP is deliberately thin: release *mechanics* (tooling, tag format,
changeset flow) are still largely repo-local, so the baseline states only the
rules that already hold everywhere and marks the rest as recorded deltas.

## When this SOP applies

A repo is in scope once it cuts versions or releases. A repo that ships no
versioned artifact inherits nothing here and needs no delta — this SOP simply
does not apply to it.

## Changelog and version consistency (mandatory when applicable)

- A repo that cuts releases maintains a `CHANGELOG.md` (the trigger recorded in
  [repository baseline files](repo-baseline-files.md)); the release entry lands
  in the same unit of work as the change, not in a later sweep.
- The declared version stays consistent across the repo's manifests and
  lockfiles. Where a repo has a version-consistency check, that check is part of
  the merge bar.

## Dependency bumps

- Dependency versions are locked by a committed lockfile. Automated bumps come
  from Dependabot as the single version-bumping actor; contributor PRs do not
  hand-bump dependencies as a side effect of unrelated work.
- Dependabot security updates are on for every repo — the security floor recorded
  in [repository baseline files](repo-baseline-files.md) — and a bump follows the
  same review bar as any other change.

## Changing a shared baseline

A substantive edit to a shared SOP or reusable workflow is itself a release: it
rides the [ENG-0004](../decisions/ENG-0004-centralize-shared-cicd.md)
review-then-propagate discipline — land it here behind review with the SOP
changelog updated, then let consumers re-point. A shared change never moves a
`@v1` tag before this repo's own gate is green.

## Recorded deltas (see the inventory for the full list)

- **photos** and **cartograph** each run a repo-local version-consistency gate
  (a `version:check`-style script) as part of CI; the exact command is a per-repo
  delta.
- **photos** additionally pins dependencies to exact versions (no semver ranges);
  most repos rely on the committed lockfile instead.
- Any repo that adopts a changeset tool records that tool and its flow as a delta
  until enough repos share it to promote the mechanics up here.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-22 — initial version; captured the changelog, version-consistency, and
  dependency-bump rules already common across repos, and scoped the rest as
  recorded deltas pending promotion (ENG-0008).
