### 3.4 Storage Optimization
- [ ] Implement storage lifecycle policies
- [ ] Configure intelligent tiering
- [ ] Identify and clean up orphaned storage
- What data access patterns justify different storage tiers?
- How long should data remain in each tier?

### 3.5 Network Cost Optimization
- [ ] Analyze data transfer costs
- [ ] Optimize cross-region and cross-AZ traffic
- [ ] Evaluate CDN for reducing egress costs
