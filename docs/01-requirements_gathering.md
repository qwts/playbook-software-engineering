# Requirements Gathering

Collects the requirements questions — functionality, user flows, UX/UI, deployment, integration, security, and performance — that must be answered before design work begins.

## 1. Application Functionality and User Experience
### 1.1 Core Features
- What are the primary functions or tasks the application must perform?
- Which features are critical for the first release versus future enhancements?

### 1.2 User Flows
- Who are the different types of end users?
- How does each user type interact with the system?
- What actions should be streamlined or automated?

### 1.3 UX/UI Considerations
- What design software should be used?
- What design system should be used?
- What design guidelines or branding requirements must be followed?
- Are there accessibility or localization needs?
- Which devices or screen sizes must be supported?

---

## 2. Deployment Strategy
### 2.1 Environment Approach
- Should the deployment be container-based or VM-based?
- Which environment constraints (regulatory, organizational) influence this decision?
- Is a hybrid approach feasible?

### 2.2 Infrastructure and Scaling
- How should the application scale under increased load?
- Are there specific hosting requirements or limitations?
- How many environments are needed (dev, test, staging, production)?

---

## 3. Database and Data Management
### 3.1 Database Requirements
- Which type of database is appropriate (relational, NoSQL, etc.)?
- What data volume and transactions are expected?
- Are there any data retention or compliance requirements?

### 3.2 Caching
- What types of data benefit from caching?
- How critical is cache invalidation and consistency?
- Should a dedicated caching service be used?

### 3.3 Messaging and Integration
- Which messages or events need to be exchanged between services?
- Should a message broker be used (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)?
- What protocols or standards are required for integration?

---

## 4. Security and Compliance
- Are there specific authentication and authorization mechanisms needed?
- Are there regulatory or compliance standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI) to consider?
- How will data be encrypted at rest and in transit?

---

## 5. Performance and Monitoring
### 5.1 Response Times and Throughput
- What are the expected response times or throughput targets?
- Are there SLA targets (e.g., p95, p99 latency)?
- What are peak load expectations?

### 5.2 Metrics and Logs
- Which metrics or logs are essential to capture?
- What retention and compliance requirements apply to logs?
- Which KPIs should be tracked?

### 5.3 Real-time Monitoring and Alerting
- How will real-time monitoring and alerting be implemented?
- Who receives alerts and through which channels?
- Are escalation policies needed?

---

## 6. Additional Considerations
### 6.1 Third-party Tools and Services
- What third-party tools or services are required?
- Are there licensing, integration, or vendor evaluation criteria?
- What fallbacks exist if a third-party service is unavailable?

### 6.2 Risks and Dependencies
- What potential risks or dependencies need mitigation?
- Are there technical, organizational, or vendor dependencies?
- How will risks be tracked and escalated?

### 6.3 Timeline and Deadlines
- What is the timeline or deadline for each phase?
- Are there fixed milestones or review gates?
- What dependencies exist between phases or teams?
