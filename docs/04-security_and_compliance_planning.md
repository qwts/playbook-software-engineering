# Security & Compliance Planning

Covers the security architecture and regulatory-compliance questions to settle before implementation: authentication, authorization, encryption, and applicable frameworks.

## 1. Lock Down Ports and Network Security
- [ ] Identify which ports are essential for application traffic
- [ ] Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) or Security Groups for least-privileged access
- [ ] Document firewall rules and IP whitelists
- Which ports can be closed or restricted?
- Are there specific firewall rules that need to be considered?

## 2. Data Encryption (At Rest and In Transit)
- [ ] Select encryption mechanisms for data at rest (KMS, Azure Key Vault, Cloud KMS)
- [ ] Configure protocols (TLS/SSL) and certificates for data in transit
- [ ] Define key management and rotation policies
- What encryption standards are required for compliance?

## 3. Logging and Monitoring for Compliance
- [ ] Identify which compliance frameworks apply (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)
- [ ] Select logging tools or services (AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, GCP Cloud Logging)
- [ ] Define log review frequency and retention requirements
- Who will have access to audit logs?

## 4. Zero Trust Principles

### 4.1 Enforce MFA and Strong Identity Verification
- [ ] Select identity provider (IAM, SSO, or other) for authentication
- [ ] Configure conditional access policies for different user roles
- [ ] Implement MFA (SMS, Authenticator apps, hardware tokens)

### 4.2 Use Short-Lived Credentials/Tokens
- [ ] Select authentication protocols (STS, OAuth2, etc.)
- [ ] Define token rotation frequency
- [ ] Implement automated mechanism for credential expiration

### 4.3 Internal Traffic Inspection (East-West)
- [ ] Identify internal traffic paths or microservices that need inspection
- [ ] Select tools or methods for internal traffic monitoring (service mesh, deep packet inspection)
- What performance impacts are acceptable for deeper inspection?

### 4.4 Integrate Policy Enforcement
- [ ] Plan integration of AWS Verified Access, Azure Private Link, or BeyondCorp principles
- [ ] Determine where policies reside (in code, centralized manager, etc.)
- How will exceptions to policies be handled and documented?

### 4.5 Continuous Monitoring and Risk-Based Access
- [ ] Define metrics or events that trigger automatic policy adjustments
- [ ] Implement anomalous behavior detection and real-time management
- [ ] Configure alerts and escalation paths for identified threats
