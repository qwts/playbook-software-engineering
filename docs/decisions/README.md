# Engineering decisions (ENG series)

Durable records for decisions that span **more than one repository**.

## What belongs here

A decision belongs in this series when it applies across repos, or when it has
no single owning repo:

- Tooling and quality-enforcement direction (linters, static analysis, CI gates)
- Conventions expected to hold in every repo (versioning, commit style, labels)
- Where things live — decision homes, documentation layout, tracking tools
- Language and platform direction affecting more than one project

## What does not

Anything owned by one repository stays in that repository. `qwts/photos` keeps
its own `ADR-NNNN` series in its wiki; a decision about photos' renderer, IPC
contract, or test strategy is a photos ADR, not an ENG record.

The test: **if exactly one repo would have to change, it is not an ENG record.**

## Numbering

`ENG-NNNN`, zero-padded, allocated in order. The prefix is deliberately distinct
from photos' `ADR-NNNN` so that a citation is never ambiguous about which series
and which home it refers to.

## Format

Short. Context, the decision, why, and consequences — including the ones you did
not like. A record that lists no downside is not finished.

Status is one of `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by ENG-NNNN`. Records are
never deleted or rewritten after acceptance; supersede them instead, so the
reasoning trail survives.
