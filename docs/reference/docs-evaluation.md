# Documentation evaluation (docs-eval)

The Phase 2 companion to [documentation governance](documentation-governance.md): where docs-gov deterministically checks that docs are well-formed, docs-eval measures whether they *work* — can an agent, given only the docs, answer the questions the org needs answered? It is SkillOpt-shaped, costs model calls, and runs on demand; it is never a merge gate. Decision record: [ENG-0010](../decisions/ENG-0010-docs-evaluation-loop.md).

## How it works

1. **Benchmark** — [`tools/docs-eval/benchmark.json`](../../tools/docs-eval/benchmark.json) holds tasks an agent should complete from the docs alone ("which gate enforces X", "what is the routing test for Y"). Each task carries deterministic grading regexes (`mustMatch`, all case-insensitive) — no LLM judge, so a grade never flakes. Tasks are split **train / validation**: train tasks may inform doc edits; validation tasks are held out.
2. **Run** — [`tools/docs-eval/run.mjs`](../../tools/docs-eval/run.mjs) stages the doc set from a git ref (or the working tree) into a temp dir, asks a fresh headless agent each question with that dir as its entire world (so code cannot answer for the docs), and grades. `--answers file.json` grades pre-collected answers instead, decoupling the executor from the grader.
3. **Gate** — [`tools/docs-eval/compare.mjs`](../../tools/docs-eval/compare.mjs) compares two result files and ACCEPTs a doc revision only if the held-out validation score does not regress and something improved. Train-split gains alone are rejected as benchmark overfitting. This is the SkillOpt validation discipline, and the same ratchet logic as the coverage floors.

## Running

```bash
npm run docs:eval                # working tree, claude CLI executor
node tools/docs-eval/run.mjs --ref main --out baseline.json
node tools/docs-eval/compare.mjs baseline.json candidate.json
```

The default executor shells out to `claude -p` per task (any authenticated Claude Code install). Results land in `tools/docs-eval/results/` — one JSON per run, committed, so scores are comparable across revisions and over time.

## Baseline evidence (2026-07-22)

Sixteen tasks, haiku-class executor, run against two revisions of this repo's docs:

| Revision | Train | Validation | Overall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pre-Phase-1 (`1c25521`) | 60% | 33% | 50% |
| Phase 1 landed (PR #13) | 100% | 100% | 100% |

`compare.mjs` verdict: **ACCEPT** — 8 tasks flipped to pass, none regressed. Honest caveat: most flipped tasks ask about docs-gov itself, which did not exist at the old revision, so this run demonstrates the *measurement mechanism* (revision-vs-revision scoring plus the held-out gate) more than it proves doc-quality gains on stable topics. The stable-topic tasks (ENG-0001 through ENG-0008 questions) passed at both revisions. One grading regex was calibrated during the baseline (hyphenated `false-positive`); expect a small calibration tail whenever tasks are added.

## Cost and cadence

A full run is 16 fresh agent sessions over a ~50k-token doc set — minutes of wall clock and well under a dollar at haiku-class pricing. Cadence per ENG-0010: after a doc change big enough to warrant it (a new ENG record, a restructure, an adoption), not scheduled and not per-PR. When docs change, extend the benchmark first, then measure the change.
